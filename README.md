# EOG-Signal-Classification
Implemented KNN, SVM, and ANN models to classify eye movements from electrooculogram (EOG) signals. • Designed a signal preprocessing pipeline with filtering and feature scaling for robust model training. • Benchmarked models on real datasets, analyzing accuracy, precision, and sensitivity to compare performance.
